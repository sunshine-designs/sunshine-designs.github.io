<h1>PowerPoint Presentation Portfolio </h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a person with an Executive Assistant background, I have extensive (as in over 20 years!) PowerPoint presentation experience.
    I am Microsoft Office Specialist Certified in PowerPoint, Word and Excel - which means that I passed with flying colors
    a rather extensive test put out by Microsoft. Many clients can vouch for my knowlege of this program! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am one of those rare &quot;original&quot; Microsoft Office users, which tells you my experience begins with the first version
    of Microsoft Word... meaning version 1.0! I remember those black screens with green type and using command keys before
    they invented &quot;the Mouse&quot;! Since those early days, I have used every version of MS Office and it's associated
    programs that has ever been released. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In PowerPoint, I have worked with media files, transitions, loopings, animations, graphics, charts, spreadsheets, templates,
    and more! Links provided here only provide a small sampling of the vast variety of presentations that I have created.
    Some of them have exceeded 10-20 megs in size, which does not always work well for providing &quot;easy to view&quot;
    samples via the internet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interested parties can always request samples to be emailed to them! </p>
